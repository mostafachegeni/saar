# Saar


- In this project, the PCB of a smartphone-controlled balloon is designed and the corresponding firmware is developed.
>     - The PCB is designed in Altium Designer Software. 
>     - A discrete PID controller is developed and implemented. 


- A total of three versions of the product are designed during the course of this project:
>     Version 1: 
>       This version is based on ATmega328 and Bluetooth module HC-05. Additionally, 
>       the firmware is implemented on ATmega328 using C/C++ in Arduino IDE. 

>     Version 2: 
>     This version is based on TI BLE IC CC2541. Additionally, 
>     the firmware is implemented on CC2541 using C in IAR Embedded Workbench. 

>     Version 3: 
>     This version is based on Nordic BLE IC nRF51822 and motion sensor MPU9250. Additionally, 
>     the firmware is implemented on nRF51822 using C in Keil ÂµVision IDE.
